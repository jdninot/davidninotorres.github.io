The article "Principles of Confounder Selection", by Tyler J. VanderWeele, published in the European Journal of Epidemiology in 2019 (PMCID: PMC6447501 PMID: [30840181](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30840181/)), highlights the importance of correctly selecting confounding factors in observational studies to make valid causal inferences. VanderWeele proposes a practical approach based on identifying variables that are causes of the exposure, the outcome, or both, and suggests excluding those that act as instrumental variables. He also considers the inclusion of proxies for unmeasured variables that may be common causes. The article seeks to balance the need to control confounding factors while avoiding the introduction of additional biases, especially in contexts where the causal structure is not fully understood.

Additionally, statistical strategies for selecting covariates in causal studies are discussed, including traditional methods such as forward/backward selection and changes in estimation, as well as more recent approaches like HDPS (High-Dimensional Propensity Scores) and machine learning techniques. It is emphasised that, despite methodological advances, substantive knowledge remains crucial for good selection.

From my experience, this article was a real gateway into the world of causal inference. I found it valuable not only for its conceptual clarity but also because VanderWeele effectively tackles a complex issue with well-grounded and practical recommendations. I consider it essential reading for those starting to face the challenge of controlling for confounding in observational studies, and a reference I return to frequently. Without a doubt, it is one of those works that leaves a lasting impact on anyone interested in causality.
