### About me

I am a statistician with a background in health data research, currently working as a research assistant in statistics at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

My research interests focus on the development and application of Bayesian statistics, stochastic processes, multilevel models, statistical learning, and causal inference in the areas of global health, epidemiology, demography, genomics, and environmental studies.

Also, I enjoy running 🏃‍♂️, swimming 🏊‍♂️, photography 📷, and philosophy 📚.
